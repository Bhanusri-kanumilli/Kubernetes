What is ingress? 
  Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services within the cluster. It serves as a configuration for an Ingress controller, defining how external traffic should be routed and distributed to services based on various rules. 
  Ingress resources are used to enable HTTP and HTTPS routing, load balancing, and host- or path-based routing for applications running in a Kubernetes cluster.
What is Ingress controller? 
  An Ingress controller is a software component that manages the configuration and routing of external traffic to services within the cluster. It is an entrypoint to clusters.
  evaluates all the rules.manages redirections.
  Ex:k8's nginx ingress controller.

workflow: 
  pod <- service <- ingress resource <- Ingress controller <-url in browser(http:my-app.com) 
we will use ingress controller in two environiments: 
1)cloud provider: loadbalancer act as entrypoint 
2)bare metal evironiment: here we have to set up a server which acts as an entry point and accepts requests from webapp and send it to internal service.
